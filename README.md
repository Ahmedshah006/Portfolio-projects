# Covid Portfolio-project
The script begins by selecting and exploring raw data from the 'CovidDeaths' and 'CovidVaccinations' tables.
It calculates various metrics including death percentages, population infection rates, and identifies countries with the highest infection counts or death rates per population.
The analysis is further segmented by continent, highlighting continents with the highest death counts per population.
Additionally, global figures for total cases, deaths, and death percentages are provided, along with an examination of the relationship between total population and vaccinations, using common table expressions (CTEs), temporary tables, and the creation of a view for later visualization.
